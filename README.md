# Color Guessing Game

A fun and interactive color guessing game where players try to guess the correct color from a set of options. The game includes animations, a score counter, sound effects for correct and incorrect guesses, and a mute button to turn off the sounds.

## Files Overview
- `index.html`: The main HTML file that structures the game and includes the necessary elements.
- `style.css`: The stylesheet that handles the design and layout of the game.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the game logic, animations, and event handling.

## Features
- **Color Guessing**: The player has to guess the color of a target from six color options.
- **Score Counter**: Tracks and displays the player's score.
- **Memory Test**: A random color is shown before the options are shuffled.
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions and effects for correct/incorrect guesses.
- **Sound Effects**: Sounds play when the player guesses correctly or incorrectly.
- **Mute Button**: A button to toggle the sound effects.
